This project is about a the composer Henry Purcell, written by an imaginary 'Purcell Society Karlsruhe'. 
As I am very interested in this composer it might be that a start this society one day.
My goal was to deliver a simple but nice layout with a nav and a footer in consistent design: grey and hovering-white.
