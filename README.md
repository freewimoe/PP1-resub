# Purcell Society Karlsruhe - Portfolio Project 1

## Project Overview

This website is dedicated to Henry Purcell and the Purcell Society Karlsruhe.  
It contains a home page with an immersive hero section, teaser boxes leading to more detailed pages, and a smart collapsible footer for information and contact.  
The site is fully responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: Full-screen background image with overlayed text and an explore button.
- **Teaser Section**: Animated boxes linking to key parts of the website.
- **Smart Footer**: Fixed collapsible footer for about, services, and contact information.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **External Links**: Open in a new tab (`target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`) for improved user experience and security.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom responsive adjustments)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Special Notes

- The **Wikipedia link** for Purcell's compositions opens in a **new tab** to prevent disrupting the user session and for security purposes.
- Personal, slightly experimental CSS comments have been used to make the development process authentic and traceable.

## Deployment

- The project is deployed via GitHub Pages.
